# Gradle for Android and Java Final Project

This project, multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud 
Endpoints was implemented. It consists
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

## Why this Project

This project is the gradle for android and java final project of udacity android development
nanodegree course. During the course of completing this project, i learnt:

* Adding free and paid flavors to an app, and setting up build to share code between them
* Factor reusable functionality into a Java library
* Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Configuring a multi project build to compile your libraries and app
* Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
